# Shading of two-axis tracking collectors

twoaxistracking is a python package for simulating the performance of two-axis tracking solar collectors, particularly for calculating self-shading.

For a quick introduction to the package, check out the [intro tutorial](../notebooks/intro_tutorial) which demonstrates the main functionality. For more further details, check out the [documentation](../documentation).

Note, in the photovoltaics community, two-axis trackers are also commonly referred to as dual-axis trackers (DAT).
