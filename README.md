# Two-axis tracking
Functions for simulation shading in fields of two-axis solar trackers.





## Dependencies
The main non-standard dependency is `shapely`, which handles the geometric operations. It is recommended install shapely with anaconda, which can be done by executing the following command in an AnacondaPrompt:

    conda install shapely

The solar modeling library `pvlib` is recommended for calculating the solar position and can similarly be installed by the command:

    conda install pvlib
